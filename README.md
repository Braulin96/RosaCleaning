# RosaCleaning

RosaCleaning is a React application that simplifies the process of booking a cleaning service. Leveraging React, Tailwind CSS, and hooks, this app provides a user-friendly experience for scheduling professional cleaning services. The challenge encountered during development was the creation of a form for booking, which has been successfully implemented. Future plans include enhancing the application with features such as dynamic forms and incorporating animations using libraries like Three.js.
